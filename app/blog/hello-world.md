## Hello, world!
####*2025/06/04*

I have always had a feeling of arrogance when ever sharing something on the internet; as though anything I would say could be of any worth to anyone else. In spite of this, I have regularly been thankful to small obscure bloggers writing about niche topics sharing information which I was otherwise unable to find.

In spirit of this niche information sharing I have decided to share some of my own findings. This will likely mostly be Emacs and web development related or occasionally linguisics as these are the areas of interest I find myself wasting the most time.

Should no one ever read this I can be thankful; saving myself embarassment and I can peacefully use this site as a personal reference to my own obscure interests. Otherwise: hello, world!
